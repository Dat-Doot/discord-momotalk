# HOW TO INSTALL
(● 0. No matter which theme you choose, you have to make sure your Discord is in Dark Mode because of limitations!)<br>
● 1. Install the Discord Desktop App, then the Vencord mod for it. (Not compatible with BetterDiscord for now!)<br>
● 2. Once on Vencord, go into Settings > Plugins, and enable the "ThemeAttributes" plugin, then restart the app.<br>
● 3. Go into Settings > Themes > Open Themes folder, and put one of these files into said folder :<br>

● 4. On Discord, press the "Load Missing Themes" button, and enable it!<br>
● 4.5 If you want, you can edit the downloaded files to put your own colors, or even a custom background image!<br>
# CHARACTERS
● 5. You can now edit the theme file to add a character to the background of chats. More characters will be added overtime! (Make sure to update to release 2.0 for this to work!)<br>
